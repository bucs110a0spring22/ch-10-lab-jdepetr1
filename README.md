Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
 Enemies move randomly throughout the window. Hero fights the enemies with random chance to win, if player loses a fight 3 times, the game is over.
#### Unique Feature
 I added a health bar that reflects the hero's current health on the top of the screen. When the hero takes damage, the health in the bar goes down. I added images in a new directory located in the 'assets' folder, which are used as the images for the healthbar sprites.
